## Description

As a bootcamp student, I needed an application that could help me keep notes for my class modules as I progressed. Through creating this app I solved the need and simultaneously sharpened my coding skills through the debugging process.

## Usage

When you open the application you can see that the notes listed. It covers each topic we learned in the modules HTM, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. When you even open the DevTools console , you can see JS running some of what we learned. In the console, it lists the topics and will choose one for us to study.
